# v0.2.0-alpha.1 - Multi-Content Release

**Released:** December 2024

## Headline: From Manuals to Multi-Content

**vDocs is no longer just for manuals.** This release transforms vDocs from a manual-generation tool into a comprehensive documentation platform supporting multiple content types.

### What Changed

Previously, vDocs only created step-by-step manuals from videos. Now you can generate **7 different document types** based on your video content:

**Instructional Documents:**
- **Step-by-Step Doc** - Tutorials, how-to guides, training materials
- **Quick Guide** - Condensed overviews for quick reference
- **Reference Document** - Technical documentation with definitions
- **Executive Summary** - High-level briefs for decision-makers

**Report Documents:**
- **Incident Report** - Document issues, damage, or problems with visual evidence
- **Inspection Report** - Condition assessments and compliance checks
- **Progress Report** - Project status and milestone documentation

### Why This Matters

- **Field workers** can record damage and generate incident reports
- **Inspectors** can document site conditions with inspection reports
- **Project managers** can capture progress updates
- **Trainers** can still create step-by-step tutorials
- **All from a simple video recording**
