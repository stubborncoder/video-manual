# Getting Started with vDocs

This guide walks you through creating your first documentation from a video.

## Prerequisites

- A screen recording or tutorial video (MP4, WebM, or other common formats)
- The video should show a clear workflow or process

## Step 1: Upload Your Video

1. Navigate to the **Videos** page (`/dashboard/videos`)
2. Click the **Upload Video** button
3. Select your video file
4. Wait for the upload to complete

## Step 2: Process the Video

1. Once uploaded, click **Process** on your video card
2. The AI will analyze the video and:
   - Identify key actions and steps
   - Extract relevant screenshots
   - Generate written instructions
3. Processing time depends on video length (typically 2-5 minutes)

## Step 3: Review and Edit

1. Go to the **Docs** page (`/dashboard/docs`)
2. Find your newly created doc
3. Click **Edit** to open the doc editor
4. Review the generated content:
   - Check screenshot accuracy
   - Refine step descriptions
   - Add or remove steps as needed

## Step 4: Export Your Documentation

1. In the doc editor, click **Export**
2. Choose your format:
   - **PDF** - Best for printing or sharing
   - **Markdown** - Best for technical documentation
   - **HTML** - Best for web publishing
3. Download your documentation

## Tips for Best Results

- **Clear recordings**: Use high-resolution, well-lit screen recordings
- **Focused content**: Keep videos focused on a single workflow
- **Steady pace**: Don't rush through steps - give the AI time to capture actions
- **Voice narration**: Optional, but can improve step descriptions
