# Manual Generation

vDocs uses AI to automatically generate step-by-step documentation from your videos.

## How It Works

1. **Video Analysis** - AI watches your video and identifies key actions
2. **Keyframe Extraction** - Important moments are captured as screenshots
3. **Step Detection** - Actions are grouped into logical steps
4. **Content Generation** - Written instructions are created for each step

## Starting Generation

1. Go to **Videos** page (`/dashboard/videos`)
2. Find your uploaded video
3. Click **Process** on the video card
4. **Set Target Audience** (optional but recommended) - e.g., "new employees", "IT administrators"
5. **Set Manual Objective** (optional but recommended) - e.g., "complete first-time setup"
6. Wait for processing to complete

### Why Set Audience & Objective?

Setting target audience and objective helps:
- AI generates content appropriate for your readers
- Evaluation checks alignment with these targets
- Better quality documentation from the start

## What Gets Generated

### Screenshots
- Automatically captured at key moments
- Shows the state before/after each action
- Can be replaced or edited later

### Step Instructions
- Clear, concise action descriptions
- Identifies UI elements and actions
- Includes context when helpful

### Structure
- Title based on video content
- Numbered steps in sequence
- Grouped by related actions

## Processing Time

| Video Length | Approximate Time |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-5 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| 5-15 minutes | 2-5 minutes |
| 15-30 minutes | 5-10 minutes |

## After Generation

Your manual will appear in the **Manuals** page (`/dashboard/manuals`). From there you can:

- **Edit** - Refine the generated content
- **Export** - Download in various formats
- **Add to Project** - Organize into a collection

## Improving Results

### Video Quality Tips
- High resolution recordings work better
- Good lighting improves screenshot quality
- Steady, deliberate mouse movements

### Content Tips
- Focus on one workflow per video
- Include pauses between major steps
- Avoid rapid context switches

## Re-Processing

If results aren't satisfactory:
1. You can delete the manual and re-process
2. Or edit the manual directly
3. Consider re-recording with better quality
